# SQL BASIC


## What is SQL ?

SQL stands for Structured Query Language and it is a language for interacting with data stored in something called a relational database.

## What is relational datebase?

It is a collection of tables that contains data.

## What is a table?

A table is just a set of rows and columns and it represents one type of entity.

## What is a row?

Each row is one record. For example if we have table representing movies one row will represent one movie.

## What is column?

Column is single attribute for all rows in the table.

## What us a query?

A query is a request for a data from datebase table ( or combination of tables)

## SELECT

```SELECT``` is a statement we use to select data from table.

```SELECT name FROM people;```

will return to us all the names in the people table

## KEYWORDS

```SELECT``` and ```FROM``` are keywords.

In SQL keywords are not case-sensitive, but it is good practice to write keywords UPPERCASE 

Semicolon ```;``` at the end of query isn't necessary but it is also good practice to put it at the end of our query.
